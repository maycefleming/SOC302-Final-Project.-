The data used in this study comes from the 2022 General Social Survey (GSS). The GSS is a nationally representative survey of adults in the United States and asks respondents a wide variety of questions about their social backgrounds and opinions. I used a subset of the data that includes valid responses from 486 participants. This dataset allowed me to look at how race, gender and sexuality, and social class relate to people’s beliefs about what helps someone get ahead in life.

The dependent variable in this study measures how respondents believe people get ahead. Although the specific question wording isn’t listed here, this kind of question usually asks whether people think success comes from things like hard work, connections, or family background.
The main independent variables include:
Race (White, Black, Other)


Gender (Man, Woman)


Sexuality (Heterosexual, Homosexual, Bisexual)


Social class/residence (such as living on a farm, in a small town, or in a city)


Education level (Less than high school, High school, Junior college, Bachelor’s degree, Graduate degree)


Financial satisfaction (Satisfied, Kind of satisfied, Not satisfied)


These variables were chosen because they relate to major social categories of inequality and are central to conflict theory.
